          <p>Springtime in <a href="https://www.michigan.org/city/ann-arbor">Ann Arbor</a> is a beautiful time. Even
            though
            it can be chilly at times, it is nice to walk my dog Bacon. This site includes some pictures I have taken on
            these walks. </p>

          <p>Sometimes we walk around the neighborhood, other times we make it to the woods. Ann Arbor also has some
            beautiful lakes and rivers including the <a
              href="https://www.annarbor.org/things-to-do/recreation-outdoors/huron-river/">Huron River Watertrail</a>
            and
            the <a href="https://www.a2gov.org/departments/Parks-Recreation/parks-places/argo/pages/default.aspx">Argo
              Park
              Cascades</a>.</p>
